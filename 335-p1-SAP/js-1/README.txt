## Intro

Additional notes about algorithm used:

### Prerequisites/ External Requirements

An IDE and text editor of your choice
Ability to connect to the internet as well

Atom text editor installation example:
To check if atom was installed type the following into terminal
```
$ which atom
```
If atom was installed you will see:
```
$ which atom
/usr/local/bin/atom
$
```
If atom didn't install you will just see:
```
$ which atom
$
```

### Setup and Installation

(A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running)

Step 1: Our first step was getting familiar with using Javascript. The entire team started with very limited knowledge on the language. 


Step 2: After familiarizing ourselves with the syntax, we began implementing the grid that was given to us by the professor. The hardest part was learning how the dependency of each file affects how your html file will run. 


Step 3: We then began learning how to move the ant between the grids without it going to far into another cell or in between the axis. Also, implementing the color change of each cell after the ant goes left or right. 


Step 4: Our end result was the image outside this txt.. after waiting for a few seconds to let the program run.. the symmetrical shape was displayed. 


### Bugs

Explain what bugs there are if any

```
The only bug our project has is the beginning of our program the screen will stay black and a few seconds it will result in the symmetrical shape
```
